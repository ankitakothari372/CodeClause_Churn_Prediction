# CodeClause_Churn_Prediction

What is Churn?

Churn prediction refers to the process of predicting which customers are likely to leave a company's product or service in the near future. Churn is a common business problem that affects many industries, including telecommunications, software as a service, and retail.
This project is focused on developing a churn prediction model using logistic regression, which is a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification problems.
